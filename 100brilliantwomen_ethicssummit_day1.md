Opening remarks

Gender equality in digital age
Digital gender divide
Access
Leadership
development
Gender equality in digital area is keyt to UN human rights
Chronic lack of diversity in tech teams:
Lacking data - don’t know how many researchers fall into demographics
Leaving development to a narrow demographic
Areas of AI impact is very broad
AI will only be as good as the diversity of teams that design and build it.
Tomorrow’s digital world should be built on equitable foundations
Goal: generation equality in the digital space

Google and Timnit Gebru
Timnit is a legendary manager at Google
This is a pattern.
Significant public stakes in this
Research integrity and research censorship. Did her paper challenge google censorship. Appear that research got spiked, and this has profound impact on our understanding of the world
Paper was critiquing large scale ML technologies, and tech at the core tech of Google search
Men have reported that they never got that level of scrutiny at google
Token diversity that is discarded once they push too hard
Google has a lot of issues not elevating people that don’t fit a certain mold
This is a deep inflection point in the field. This is no longer a thought experiment. We need to rally, to fight
Fight for whistleblower protections, etc
Technologies created in the image of corporate incentives and white male prerogative are dangerous for the rest of us. This is not a thought experiment.
Ethics Washing
How can we make this have a positive outcome?
Tech works need a union. But don’t adopt a model without scrutiny 
Committed to anti-racism
Committed to giving workers social control
‘Assume good intent’ crowd sows doubt. 
Power retrenches. It doesn’t give up without a fight. From gaslighting to explicit racist profiling.
Having all the accolades and all the acclaim does not protect us. Require sisterhood solidarity.
Time for planning is over
=========
Deep skepticism of data having the ability to accurately reflect the world, even at low levels
Alerted to concerns around AI boom around 2014. Commodification of ai tech. 
Drive to take any random data set, any janky data set, make some model, and project out to the world
Good marketing strategy for google, but systems are flawed/riddled with problems
People close to the action and in debate were in private companies
Motivation for institute - take discussion and systems out of the corporate environment 
Who are tech workers?
High skilled, high level, all the way down to the gig workers who lives are controlled and defined by the tech companies
What would it take to consolidate? And to be inclusive?
Retaliation at Google (M.W organized google walkout)
20,000 people around the globe
Not surprising: knew history and thinks about power
But it followed the playbook - publicly praised, and then privately hemming it down to recognizable language
Retaliation against organizers: find people who they think are leading, hurt them, and hope it sends a message
In tech, what does it mean to hurt organizers? You hurt their career.
Shift the procedures around which she could work
Shutting down prospects one by one
Efforts to organize between/across companies
Amazon workers are a good example, where tech workers organized with warehouse workers
Connected issues with business models
FB workers and content moderators
FB moderators organized and brought a lawsuit against FB
Visibility can be an tactic, but that doesn’t work for everyone. Some organization is behind the scenes by design
No Tech for ICE movement
Cross-company solidarity

Ethical AI/Ethical Tech
Don’t overlook people impacted on tech
Don’t overlook people forced to build it
People employed to label data
Gig Economy
https://logicmag.io/security/a-brief-history-of-the-gig/ 
Framing things with technology makes them seem complex, off limits for people without fancy CS degree, and frame it as off limits for workers
Tech colonizing markets
Wages seem ok to begin with, and get people hooked, and then free to drop wages underneath them.
Prop 22
About AB 5(?) law from organized by gig workers to have them b
Prop 22 instantiates a low-rights class of worker
It’s starting with gig workers, but it’s the intention the expand that category
Signal Foundation
50c3 non-profit. Makes the Signal App
MW worked in security and privacy
Privacy tech a core 
Organizing and serious strategizing all happened over Signal. Important because adversary is the most technologically sophisticated company out there
Need to have private, unsure conversations without employer looking over their shoulders
Essential technology
Organizing has stakes and risks
You know your own risks the best
In general, don’t trust management. Escalate proper pipelines, but HR and other avenues are often traps and not on your side
If you’re going to speak up, a lone voice IS a target. Think how you’re going to speak up with your co-workers
Connective tissue of solidarity
Power map: what do you want and who has the power to give it to you?
Look into organizing 101

The use of AI systems to detect and classify race and gender is an urgent need to reexamination
Scientifically flawed
Easily abused
"what if we started our ethics stance with everything is broken..."
‘Potential’ (Anna Lauren)
Asked to ground ourselves in the positive potential of a technology
Way of putting critical voices as ‘outside’ from the get go
Define the terms of the debate
What if ethics starts from the stance that everything is broken
Language (Kandrea Wade)
Very PR language
We have the technology to be inclusive, esp through connectivity
Pr language of hoping for a better tomorrow is something to make the company look good
Not protecting the employees, not protecting the users
Diverse teams
Also about inclusive culture.
Hiring a diverse team to work within a non-inclusive culture does not solve the problem
Put diverse teams into environment that supports diversity
Then it applies to the AI itself
Applies to infrastructure 
Language (Alex Hanna)
Language of diversity and inclusion vs what is actually happening
Power and Actors (Alex Ahmad)
Who has power, who makes decisions, and who gets blame
Universities are a part of this
Academic industry military complex
Tech recruits phd students, and funnels these into these culture
Universities have the venere of ‘surely it must be meaningful, surely for the public good’
Carnegie Mellon - contract with the army to make autonomous tanks and humvees
Universities have economic realities and they are complicit in the system
U. Toronto Paper: Big Tobacco and Big Tech 
What if big tobacco and big oil had conferences like big tech does?
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13676.pdf
AI systems as discriminating systems. What would it take to re-image systems to be inclusive? Not biased?
Kandrea
Start from ground level. Have people from diverse backgrounds working on the infrastructure 
Focus on how identity is operationalized
How are decisions of classifications made? Classifications on things like gender, race are presented as ground truth and in-disputable, which is not true
Data has historical bias. Harmful and outdated data is used to train
Needs to be more accountability on how classifications for humans are defined
Collectively deciding reasoning. No one person should decide on one classification for groups.
Embedding classifications
Reflexivity leads to gaps in knowledge. Can only be filled by diverse individuals

Trans Voice Training (Alex Ahmed)
Working on trans voice training apps.
It was complicated and messy. Standard problems: this app is not gendering me correctly, but you want the system to get it right but the parameters are opac
What does ‘winning’/gendered correctly look like to each individual.
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07399.pdf
Frameworks of Fairness (Anna Lauren)
Struggle: aim to reproduce the problem in the first place. 
https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/gender-shades/overview/
Capitalism (“The big C word has entered the building”)
People don’t want to be classified. Classification can be a form of violence.
Dealing with people who reject refusal to to take seriously?
Taylor Technologies
The system we are designing will work for all users is an assumption
Should we explore branching technologies, not following the one path for all
Forks and branches addressing diversity
Be wary of where your ethics is grounded

Observations and Thoughts

Draw your lines, and think about how you are complicit
Shop at amazon? Use Uber and Lyft?

How much do tech companies spend on lobbying? On campaigns for Prop 22? And how does that compare with what they could have spent supporting those workers?

HR is not there to project you. There are there to protect the company

Where did the goal of classification for everything come from? Why is the foundation of capital creation of companies?
